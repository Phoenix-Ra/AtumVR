# AtumVR

Library that simplifies VR development in Java. It can be used either:

- directly in a Java-based game/app, or
- to add VR support to an existing game/app via a mod (when the game/modding platform allows it).

AtumVR uses **LWJGL** to access native VR APIs and currently supports **OpenXR only**.

This project is **not a full game engine**. Instead, it is intended to be a VR integration layer you can plug into your own engine or framework—so you don’t have to wrestle with low-level VR APIs directly.
